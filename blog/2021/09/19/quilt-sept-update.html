<p>It has been a few months since the last update on the Quilt Project.</p>

<p>Quilt has progressed far since that initial “This is Quilt” blog with: new teams set up; several important RFCs being published and developments in many key areas.</p>

<h2 id="clean-room-rfc-33">Clean Room RFC-33</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0033-quilt-mappings-and-clean-room.md">RFC-33 has been merged</a>. This RFC changes how Quilt is dealing with other mappings (such as MojMap, MCP and Yarn).</p>

<p>Key Take-Aways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quilt’s fork of Yarn will be renamed to “Quilt Mappings” (QM)</li>
  <li>All restrictions on referencing mappings projects (other than Quilt Mappings) within Quilt’s community and development spaces will be lifted</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasoning, possible outcomes, drawbacks and smaller changes are outlined further in the RFC document.</p>

<h3 id="quilt-mappings">Quilt Mappings</h3>
<p>As noted above, Quilt Mappings (QM) exist and are open to contributions.</p>

<h2 id="quilt-standard-library-qsl">Quilt Standard Library (QSL)</h2>

<p>The Quilt Standard Library (Quilt’s separation of the current Fabric API into distinct modules – see <a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0009-qsl-structure.md">RFC-9</a>), now has the resource loader and base (for events).</p>

<p>We are looking for help testing the resource loader. This can be done by using the snapshot maven repo with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.quiltmc.qsl.core:resource-loader:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</code>.</p>

<p>QSL is seeing new additions on top of the reorganization into modules.</p>

<h2 id="quilt-mod-json">Quilt Mod JSON</h2>
<p>The Quilt Mod JSON has now been mostly implemented. The design of this is outlined in <a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/specification/0002-quilt.mod.json.md">RFC-2</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of the work left is smooth out issues in the loader.</p>

<h2 id="quiltflower">QuiltFlower</h2>
<p>QuiltFlower (Quilt’s Fork/Maintained version of FernFlower/ForgeFlower) has seen some smaller changes.</p>

<p>These changes should make de-complied code more readable. An example of this can be seen in the following images:</p>

<p><strong>Output produced by FabricFlower</strong>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/M81I32X.png" alt="Output Produced by Fabric Flower" /></p>

<p><strong>Same output, produced using QuiltFlower</strong>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1ICd4Nb.png" alt="Same output produced by Quilt Flower" /></p>

<h2 id="new-moderators">New Moderators</h2>
<p>Quilt’s community spaces are always looking for new moderators. If you think you’d be a good fit and like to be involved, you can submit an application via ModMail.</p>

<p>Some key documents to be aware of <strong>before</strong> applying:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://quiltmc.org/community/code-of-conduct.html">The Quilt Code of Conduct</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://quiltmc.org/community/rules.html">Quilt’s Rules</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://quiltmc.org/community/moderation.html">Our Moderation Ethos</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/blob/master/structure/0007-community-team.md">RFC-7 (The Community Team Structure)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If the qualities outlined in the above documents, seem like you… please step forward and apply. The interview process will follow the steps outlined in RFC-7 (TL;DR):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply Via ModMail</li>
  <li>Interview with a Community Manager (and the wider Community Team)</li>
  <li>Community team holds a vote based on the interview</li>
  <li>Result of the vote given to interviewee, and if successful the applicant will become a Trainee Moderator</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modding-with-quilt--fabric">Modding with Quilt &amp; Fabric</h2>

<h3 id="can-i-mod-with-quilt-at-the-moment">Can I mod with Quilt at the moment?</h3>

<p>It is currently not possible to mod with the Quilt framework.</p>

<p>However, progress has been made. We are currently waiting on a Gradle Plugin.</p>

<p><strong>We are looking for contributors.</strong> If you would like to help out with this part of the project, please reach out in <a href="https://canary.discord.com/channels/833872081585700874/884090296068091965/885866814410723358">#build-tools-general</a> and express interest. A member of the relevant team will reach out.</p>

<h3 id="are-things-still-compatible-with-fabric">Are things still compatible with Fabric?</h3>

<p>Things are largely compatible with loading mods.</p>

<p>Mixin Plugins may not be possible to maintain compatibility.  We may consider contributing to some mods that use them, to aid in replacing them.</p>

<h2 id="round-off">Round-off</h2>
<p>That is all for now! When there are more things to talk about, they will be published here; for more bleeding edge changes and updates on the project, follow along on our <a href="https://discord.quiltmc.org">Discords</a>.</p>

<p>Thank-you to the Quilt Project’s team for helping flesh this out; it would have otherwise been just an update on moderators.</p>
