        <div class="admonition">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This document is specific to Discord. If you’re not making use of our community spaces on Discord, Tupperbox
won’t be available.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Runi-c/Tupperbox">Tupperbox</a> is a Discord bot that exists to allow users to proxy their messages
via Discord webhooks. This has many practical applications, especially given that Discord doesn’t have any features
that support the plural community, or any built-in mental health aids.</p>

<p>Tupperbox has many fun and interesting uses for all kinds of situations, but in Quilt community spaces it should only 
be used for <a href="#plurality">plurality</a> or self-identity purposes, or as a mental health aid. We do not allow users to make use of 
Tupperbox for role-playing.</p>

<p>If you see users talking with the bot tag, they’re talking through Tupperbox. You can react to any message sent this
way with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">question</code> emote (❓) for information on which Discord account the message belongs to.</p>

<h2 id="general-usage">General Usage</h2>

<p>The primary function of Tupperbox is automatically proxying messages that people using it send, in order to make those
messages appear to come from someone else. This is done by making use of Discord webhooks - which has the unfortunate
side effect of Discord stating that the messages were sent by a bot. Rest assured that this isn’t the case - while the
messages were proxied by Tupperbox, they were written by another member of the community</p>

<p>As a member of the community, there’s only one Tupperbox feature available to you by default - the ability to figure 
out which Discord account was used to send a proxied message. You can do this by reacting to any proxied message using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">question</code> emote (❓), which will cause Tupperbox to send you a private message like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That proxy was sent by <a href="#">@user</a> (tag: user#0000 - id: 000000000000000000).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No commands are available by default.</p>

<h2 id="applying-for-access">Applying for Access</h2>

<p>If you’d like to make use of Tupperbox, you’ll need to ask to be given the <strong>Tupperbox Access</strong> role. You can do this
by simply sending a private message to the <strong>@ModMail</strong> bot, stating that you’d like to use Tupperbox and providing a
short description of why you’d like to use it.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to it - once a moderator has a chance to address your message, you’ll be given the role!</p>

<p>Once you have access to Tupperbox, you’ll also be granted access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#tupperbox-posting</code> channel - this channel
exists to allow you to make use of the Tupperbox commands somewhere that isn’t visible to other community members. Feel
free to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tul!help</code> here for information on how to work with Tupperbox.</p>

<h2 id="moving-from-pluralkit">Moving from PluralKit</h2>

<p>If you already have a system set up on PluralKit, you can easily import that system to Tupperbox. Simply follow these
steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Send a private message to PluralKit: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pk;export</code></li>
  <li>Copy the link that PluralKit gives you, to use in the next step</li>
  <li>Send a private message to Tupperbox: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tul!import LINK</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="moderation-notes">Moderation Notes</h2>

<p>When working with Tupperbox, please note that our moderation policy is one of system accountability, meaning that
<a href="#plurality">plural systems</a> are responsible for their members. Unfortunately, there’s no practical way to moderate
system members individually - the community team is only able to target the Discord account you’re using when acting
as moderators.</p>

<p>If you’re part of a plural system, we suggest that you talk with the other members of your system and make sure they’re
aware of this.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="plurality">Plurality?</h2>

<div class="admonition">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pluralities are not the only valid reason to make use of a tool like Tupperbox, but it’s by far the most 
common use for it in our community spaces - so we created this section to help explain the concept. Any gatekeeping of
these types of tools will not be tolerated in Quilt community spaces, but you’re always welcome to contact a member of 
the community team directly if you have any concerns.</p>
</div>

<p>Plurality is the concept of multiple people sharing a single body, inhabiting the same brain. Many people’s first
(or only) experience with this is from people with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), but there are many other
situations that can cause something like this to happen - and in many cases, <strong>the existence of a plurality is not
problematic or negative</strong>. As <a href="https://morethanone.info/">More Than One</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plurality (or multiplicity) is the existence of multiple self-aware entities inside one physical brain.</p>

  <p>You could think of a plural collective as a group of lifelong roommates, but with a body instead of an apartment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, this group of entities tends to be known as a <strong>plural system</strong>.</p>

<p>When interacting with plural people, remember to treat each individual member of a plural system with respect. Don’t
pathologise their identity (for example, by asking to meet the “real” person or suggesting that they need to be 
“cured”), and remember that many plural people consider their identity more a matter of philosophy than of medicine. 
Additionally, treat each system member as separate people, with their own memories, experiences and personality - If 
they ask you to treat them in a specific way, listen to them and follow their lead as best you can.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that plurality is a whole world and plural systems often greatly differ from each other,
sometimes identifying or manifesting themselves in completely different ways. All plural systems are valid, regardless
of how their members identify or interact, how they were formed, or how they think about themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This site belongs to a specific plural system, and much of what’s written there is related to their personal
experiences of plurality. Additionally, some articles there were written quite some time ago, and may contain vulgar
language and outdated terminology - including terms that exist outside the plural community. Nonetheless, it remains 
a popular and useful resource for people approaching plurality and plural systems from the outside.</p>
