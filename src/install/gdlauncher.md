# GDLauncher <a href="https://gdevs.io" class="button is-link is-pulled-right"><span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-globe"></i></span><span>Website</span></a>

### Status: Work In Progress

GDLauncher does not currently support Quilt, but a member of the community has 
[submitted a pull request](https://github.com/gorilla-devs/GDLauncher/pull/1400) that adds Quilt support. If you're 
interested in seeing Quilt support in GDLauncher, feel free to take a look at that PR.

# Workaround

As a workaround to use Quilt in GDLauncher until the pull request is finished and merged you can create a Forge profile where you install [JumpQuilt](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jumpquilt), which is a mod that hijacks the launching process so that Quilt is loaded instead of Forge.
