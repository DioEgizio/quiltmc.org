### Status: Planned

CurseForge does not currently support Quilt, but they've stated they're planning on it. 

Thanks to Claycorp, RedBlue and Yamza for their help, as well as to everyone that supported our
[CurseForge Ideas suggestion](https://curseforge-ideas.overwolf.com/ideas/CF-I-2662). We couldn't have gotten this far 
without you!

# Workaround

As a workaround to use Quilt in CurseForge modpacks or in their launcher, you can create a Forge profile where you install [JumpQuilt](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jumpquilt), which is a mod that hijacks the launching process so that Quilt is loaded instead of Forge.
